## Crowfunding Description
This repository contains a jupyternotebook that has the codes for building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods. As a team, we utilise pandas method rather than the regular expressions to extract and transform the data. 

Four CSV files were generated at the end of the ETL process (campaign.csv, contacts.csv, category.csv and subcategory.csv). These files were used to create an ERD and a table schema which are within this repository. 


## Installations
