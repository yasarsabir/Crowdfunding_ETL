## Crowfunding Description
This repository contains a jupyternotebook that has the codes for building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods. As a team, we utilised the pandas method rather than the regular expressions (regex) to extract and transform the data. 

Four CSV files were generated at the end of the ETL process (campaign.csv, contacts.csv, category.csv and subcategory.csv), which are all located with the resouces folder. These files were used to create an ERD (using DBD saved as a png ) and a crowdfunding table schema. All of these files which are within this repository.
